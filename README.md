# Rainfall prediction
This project aims to predict whether there will be rainfall tommorow or not (Yes/No). The dataset comprises of information like humidity, wind speed, wind direction, presence of clouds or sunshine, etc. These factors have been analysed statistically and graphically (using seaborn and matplotlib plots) to extract patterns and to select the features that substantially affect rainfall.

ML classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random forest and XGBoost have been implemented on the aforementioned features to predict the occcurence of rainfall.
